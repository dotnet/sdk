.SH NAME

\f[C]dotnet clean\f[R] - Cleans the output of a project.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\f[C]
dotnet clean [<PROJECT>|<SOLUTION>] [-c|--configuration] [-f|--framework] [--interactive] 
    [--nologo] [-o|--output] [-r|--runtime] [-v|--verbosity]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet clean\f[R] command cleans the output of the previous build.
It\[cq]s implemented as an MSBuild target, so the project is evaluated when the command is run.
Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned.
Both intermediate (\f[I]obj\f[R]) and final output (\f[I]bin\f[R]) folders are cleaned.
.SS Arguments
.PP
\f[C]PROJECT | SOLUTION\f[R]
.PP
The MSBuild project or solution to clean.
If a project or solution file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in \f[I]proj\f[R] or \f[I]sln\f[R], and uses that file.
