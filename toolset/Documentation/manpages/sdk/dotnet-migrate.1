.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R] command migrates a valid Preview 2 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based project to a valid .NET Core SDK-style \f[I]csproj\f[R] project.
.PP
By default, the command migrates the root project and any project references that the root project contains.
This behavior is disabled using the \f[C]--skip-project-references\f[R] option at runtime.
.PP
Migration can be performed on the following assets:
.IP \[bu] 2
A single project by specifying the \f[I]project.json\f[R] file to migrate.
.IP \[bu] 2
All of the directories specified in the \f[I]global.json\f[R] file by passing in a path to the \f[I]global.json\f[R] file.
.IP \[bu] 2
A \f[I]solution.sln\f[R] file, where it migrates the projects referenced in the solution.
.IP \[bu] 2
On all subdirectories of the given directory recursively.
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R] command keeps the migrated \f[I]project.json\f[R] file inside a \f[C]backup\f[R] directory, which it creates if the directory doesn\[cq]t exist.
This behavior is overridden using the \f[C]--skip-backup\f[R] option.
.PP
By default, the migration operation outputs the state of the migration process to standard output (STDOUT).
If you use the \f[C]--report-file <REPORT_FILE>\f[R] option, the output is saved to the file specify.
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R] command only supports valid Preview 2 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based projects.
This means that you cannot use it to migrate DNX or Preview 1 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based projects directly to MSBuild/csproj projects.
You first need to manually migrate the project to a Preview 2 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based project and then use the \f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R] command to migrate the project.
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R] command is no longer available starting with .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
.SS Arguments
.PP
\f[C]PROJECT_JSON/GLOBAL_JSON/SOLUTION_FILE/PROJECT_DIR\f[R]
.PP
The path to one of the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]project.json\f[R] file to migrate.
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]global.json\f[R] file: the folders specified in \f[I]global.json\f[R] are migrated.
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]solution.sln\f[R] file: the projects referenced in the solution are migrated.
.IP \[bu] 2
a directory to migrate: recursively searches for \f[I]project.json\f[R] files to migrate inside the specified directory.
.PP
Defaults to current directory if nothing is specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[C]--format-report-file-json <REPORT_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Output migration report file as JSON rather than user messages.
.PP
\f[C]-h|--help\f[R]
.PP
Prints out a short help for the command.
.PP
\f[C]-r|--report-file <REPORT_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Output migration report to a file in addition to the console.
.PP
\f[C]-s|--skip-project-references [Debug|Release]\f[R]
.PP
Skip migrating project references.
By default, project references are migrated recursively.
.PP
\f[C]--skip-backup\f[R]
.PP
Skip moving \f[I]project.json\f[R], \f[I]global.json\f[R], and \f[I]*.xproj\f[R] to a \f[C]backup\f[R] directory after successful migration.
.PP
\f[C]-t|--template-file <TEMPLATE_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Template csproj file to use for migration.
By default, the same template as the one dropped by \f[C]dotnet new console\f[R] is used.
.PP
\f[C]-v|--sdk-package-version <VERSION>\f[R]
.PP
The version of the sdk package that\[cq]s referenced in the migrated app.
The default is the version of the SDK in \f[C]dotnet new\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]-x|--xproj-file <FILE>\f[R]
.PP
The path to the xproj file to use.
Required when there is more than one xproj in a project directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Migrate a project in the current directory and all of its project-to-project dependencies:
.PP
\f[C]dotnet migrate\f[R]
.PP
Migrate all projects that \f[I]global.json\f[R] file includes:
.PP
\f[C]dotnet migrate path/to/global.json\f[R]
.PP
Migrate only the current project and no project-to-project (P2P) dependencies.
Also, use a specific SDK version:
.PP
\f[C]dotnet migrate -s -v 1.0.0-preview4\f[R]
