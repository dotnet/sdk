# dotnetup `Preview` Release Strategy

`dotnetup` ships today as a small internal preview built daily from the tip of the internal CI pipeline. SDK `main` consumes that daily build.

The problem: every daily change reaches every CI consumer, so we cannot let an SDK servicing/release branch depend on a *stable* dotnetup without it being broken by an unrelated daily change once we remove the `.NET Install Script` fallback.

---

## 1. Requirements

### Decisions: preview / phase 1

**Must have**
- Allow others to download prior releases, even when unsupported (the intent is to let customers roll back without our intervention). Prior versions are downloadable today as immutable per-version `ci.dot.net` URLs; the underlying `dotnetbuilds` blob retention window has no formal retention policy for these artifacts, however.
- Fast (within 15 minutes of detection) rollback or re-release when something goes wrong.
- Develop features without risk of them reaching a stable release.
- Preview consumption / telemetry on a dev branch to confirm stability before promoting to stable.
- Only support 'latest' preview to reduce maintenance burden and move fast.
- Compliance with MSFT policy.

**Nice to have**
- No PRs required to bump minor versions.
- Automated changelog notes.
- Only maintain one branch at a time.
- Minimal manual maintenance effort burdens to release.
- Clear UX with `dotnetup --version` (existing today) that helps report and track issues tied to a specific version

**Not necessary**
- Truly supporting multiple dotnetup versions simultaneously.
- Backporting.

### Decisions: public / stable preview

**Additional must have**
- CDN routing for high-scale / geolocation downloads (`builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`).
  (`ci.dot.net` likely cannot serve a large public download swath.)
- Vendor testing plan to release a stable release.

**Additional nice to have**
- `dotnetup` inclusion in a `json` manifest (likely required for automatic updates).

---

## 2. Assumptions

- `ci.dot.net` could not scale to the full potential dotnetup customer base, even though it is fronted by Azure Front Door over blob storage.
- `stable` needs to scale beyond `ci.dot.net`; `preview` may not (external customers should not build production CI on top of a preview product).
- GitHub Releases may provide scalable / CDN-like downloads (works for dotnet diagnostics).
- `aka.ms` has no Azure Front Door / `x-cache` / Akamai layer of its own. It is a Kestrel app serving a `301` redirect, which is sufficient for `preview` and `daily`.
- `ci.dot.net` per-version build URLs persist long enough for `dotnetup` rollback needs. See [Retention investigation](#appendix-a-retention-investigation-dotnetbuildscidotnet) below.

### Verified infrastructure facts

- The aka.ms daily links are `301` redirects served by **Kestrel** (no CDN of their own):

 `https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/daily/dotnetup-win-x64.exe` →

  ```
    https://ci.dot.net/public/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe
  ```

 `https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/daily/dotnetup-win-x64.exe.sha512` →


  ```
  https://ci.dot.net/public-checksums/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe.sha512
  ```

- Both resolved explicit-version URLs return `200` (binary = 16,143,696 bytes; checksum = 128 bytes).
- `ci.dot.net` fronts `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` via **Azure Front Door**
  (`x-azure-ref` present, `X-Cache: TCP_MISS`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800` = 7 days,
  `x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob`). dotnetup daily already lands here today.
- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` fronts `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` via **Akamai** (`Akamai-GRN` present, no `x-azure-ref`). Reaching it requires a promotion (copy) from `dotnetbuilds` → `dotnetcli`, gated by the release team's staging process. The account→CDN mapping is encoded in Arcade's `PublishingConstants.cs`.

- dotnetup's Arcade channel, with `targetFeeds: DotNetToolsFeeds` publishes installers/checksums to `dotnetbuilds/public` and
  `dotnetbuilds/public-checksums`. i.e. we are **already in staging**.

- The versioned blob layout `dotnetup/$(DotnetupVersion)/dotnetup-$(TargetRid)$(_DotnetupNativeExt)`
  is set in [eng/Publishing.props](../../../../eng/Publishing.props) (`SetDotnetupBlobPaths`).

- The install scripts default to `Quality=daily` and resolve `https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/<quality>`
  ([scripts/get-dotnetup.sh](../../../../scripts/get-dotnetup.sh),
  [scripts/get-dotnetup.ps1](../../../../scripts/get-dotnetup.ps1)).

## 3. Comparisons

- **aspire** — owns its own download site (`aspire.dev`) plus npm, WinGet, other packages, and GitHub Releases. Includes rich channel identity (stable / staging / daily / local / pr), release branches, and SHA-derived staging feeds. Promotion is *manual*: the release pipeline is queued against a selected build, extracts its BAR ID, and runs `darc add-build-to-channel`. Product SemVer is hand-authored in `eng/Versions.props`, not auto-bumped.
  ([release-process.md](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/blob/main/docs/release-process.md))
- **az cli** — `dev` branch is an `edge` build via `aka.ms`. Official uses WinGet, MSI, and ZIP (served from Microsoft-hosted blob storage behind `aka.ms` links) plus Microsoft package feeds.
  ([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?pivots=zip))
- **gh cli** — WinGet, Homebrew, custom Linux package feed. **Stable releases only**; no daily/edge channel. "Build from source" is for contributors, not a distribution channel.

Takeaway: dotnetup's ideal is the *lighter half* of Aspire's model. i.e. Separate daily from a blessed selector with immutable versioned artifacts.

## 4. Versions Policy

| Channel  | Version shape | Meaning |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| daily    | `0.x.y`       | Moving, as-is, built from active development tip. No stability promise. |
| preview  | `0.x.y`       | Blessed internal preview. The latest supported version. |
| stable   | `1.0.0`       | Public, CDN-scaled release (future). |

Explicit immutable version selectors remain downloadable for historical acquisition and rollback.
These are real, working URLs today — verified `200` on 2026-06-11, e.g.:

- `https://ci.dot.net/public/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe`
- `https://ci.dot.net/public-checksums/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe.sha512`

## 5. Plan (phased)

### Phase 0 — Current

Daily channel available. `aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/daily/...` points at the latest published daily
build on `ci.dot.net`. SDK `main` consumes daily. No tags, no GitHub Release, no blessed selector.
The dotnetup CI pipeline ([.vsts-dnup-ci.yml](../../../../.vsts-dnup-ci.yml)) triggers on the
`dnup`, `release/dnup`, and `release/dotnetup` branches today.

### Phase 1 — Blessed `preview` selector

1. **Maintain one branch: `release/dnup`.**
2. **Expose both `/daily/` and `/preview/` URLs.** Daily keeps tracking the moving tip; preview resolves to a 'blessed' build. (But still not 'blessed' to actually tell external customers to use in production.)
3. **Change which `/daily/` build `/preview/` points at via an explicit process**
   Implement a `release` pipeline that lets an operator select a set of dotnetup release artifacts from a prior daily pipeline run.
4. **The release pipeline:**
   - Bumps the patch version by 1 off of the last tagged preview patch version using global `msbuild` parameters. Coordinate to push a PR via maestro or via actions that bumps the version in the real branch. Produce the preview versioned dotnetup `tag`.
   - Pushes that tag onto the commit from the selected daily pipeline run.
   - Sets `preview` version metadata property `PreReleaseVersionLabel` as a global property override using the same methodology as the .NET SDK.
   - Runs tests on that branch.
   - On pass: repins the `/preview/` `aka.ms` url (only if `test` run is not enabled), and creates the GitHub Release with change notes.

**Recovery — if only a simple revert is needed:**
1. Re-run the `release` pipeline against an existing tag and repoint the `/preview/` URL. Allow skipping tests if needed (break-glass.)
   Archival CI URLs exist per version and are confirmed live today, e.g.
   `https://ci.dot.net/public/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe` and its
   `.../public-checksums/dotnetup/0.1.4-preview.4.26303.1/dotnetup-win-x64.exe.sha512` sidecar.
   **Open (low risk):** No formal retention/TTL policy is documented for `dotnetbuilds` blobs — see
   [Retention investigation](#appendix-a-retention-investigation-dotnetbuildscidotnet). Empirical evidence shows
   non-promoted preview builds from 4+ years ago remain accessible, and dotnetup builds are never
   subject to promotion-cleanup. We consider the rollback-via-repoint strategy safe for practical
   timescales, though confirming definitively requires Azure portal access from dnceng.

**Recovery — fix needed (e.g. security patch on an old branch):**
1. Check out the tagged commit.
2. Create `release/dnup/<tag-version>/hotfix-x.y.z` off the tag.
3. Open an internal PR with the fix into that branch and get approval.
4. Run the release pipeline (which runs tests) and repoint the selector.

This phase allows a public preview. I view arcade rollout as valid around this time once we see stabilization of the public preview, but also potential arcade rollout with a fallback during `preview`.

In this phase, before public preview we'd remove the fallback to the .NET Install Script, but keep the fallback on the `daily` dotnetup builds, and keep `release/dnup` using the `daily` dotnetup builds to build. (This prevents a broken `dotnetup` from preventing us from shipping a new `dotnetup`.)

### Phase 2 — Stable on `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` (tentative)

Migrate to `stable` versioning as well. Confirm whether it is actually feasible and correct to only support a latest version if it becomes a 'released' product.

Host a `stable` URL on `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` by coordinating with the release team to use their promotion pipeline — we already push to `dotnetbuilds`, so this is a copy/promote from
`dotnetbuilds` → `dotnetcli` plus storage write permissions granted by the release/dnceng team.

Similar release process, through coordination. Possibly automate `preview` releases at this point. Required to rollout to any azdo task.

### Phase 3 — Package-manager acquisition (tentative)

Linux Package Manager Feed / WinGet / Homebrew / etc. Needs discussion with partners.

## Appendix A: Retention Investigation (`dotnetbuilds`/`ci.dot.net`)

*Investigated 2026-06-12.*

### Summary

There is **no documented retention policy** for `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` / `ci.dot.net`.
Arcade's `PublishingConstants.cs` `TargetChannelConfig` has no `retentionDays`, `expirationDays`, or
`lifecyclePolicy` field. No retention documentation exists in `dotnet/arcade` or `dotnet/dnceng`.
Any Azure Blob lifecycle policy would be configured in the Azure portal (not in public repos).

### Empirical HTTP probe results (2026-06-12)

| Build | Age | `ci.dot.net` | `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` | Explanation |
|-------|-----|:---:|:---:|---|
| .NET 6.0 preview 1 (Mar 2021) | ~5 yr | ❌ 404 | ✅ 200 | **Promoted** to dotnetcli, cleaned from dotnetbuilds |
| .NET 6.0 preview 7 (Aug 2021) | ~5 yr | ❌ 404 | ✅ 200 | Promoted |
| .NET 7.0 preview 1 (Feb 2022) | ~4.3 yr | ✅ 200 | — | Never promoted; still on staging |
| .NET 7.0 preview 3–7 (Mar–Jul 2022) | ~4 yr | ✅ 200 | — | Never promoted |
| .NET 7.0 RC1/RC2 (Sep–Oct 2022) | ~4 yr | ❌ 404 | ✅ 200 | Promoted |
| .NET 7.0 GA (Nov 2022) | ~4 yr | ❌ 404 | ✅ 200 | Promoted |
| .NET 8.0 preview 1 (Feb 2023) | ~3.3 yr | ✅ 200 | — | Never promoted |
| .NET 9.0 preview 1 (Feb 2024) | ~2.3 yr | ✅ 200 | — | Never promoted |
| dotnetup 0.1.4-preview (Jun 2026) | current | ✅ 200 | — | DotNetToolsFeeds; never promoted |

### Interpretation

The 404s on `ci.dot.net` are **not** from age-based TTL deletion. They are the result of a
deliberate **promotion workflow**: once a build graduates from staging (`dotnetbuilds`) to production
(`dotnetcli` / `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`), the staging copy is cleaned up.

Since dotnetup uses `DotNetToolsFeeds` (which only targets `dotnetbuilds/public`), its builds are
**never subject to promotion-cleanup**. Non-promoted preview/daily builds from as far back as
Feb 2022 (~4.3 years) remain accessible at this time.

### Conclusion for dotnetup rollback

We consider the rollback-via-repoint strategy (pointing `/preview/` at an older versioned URL) safe
for practical timescales. The risk of silent blob deletion is low but cannot be formally ruled out
without Azure portal access from the dnceng team.

## Appendix B: Automated GitHub Releases

Automated GitHub Release creation from CI is compliant with Microsoft policy and is established
practice across the dotnet org. Arcade does not provide a shared release stage; each repo
implements its own using one of the patterns below.

### Precedent in the dotnet org

| Repo | Pattern | Auth | Human gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| dotnet/aspire | AzDO dispatches GitHub Actions via `aspire-repo-bot` App | GitHub App token | AzDO approval stage |
| dotnet/dotnet-monitor | AzDO pipeline runs `gh release create` | KeyVault-backed `dotnet-bot` PAT | `ManualValidation@1` |
| dotnet/android-native-tools | AzDO `GitHubRelease@1` task | AzDO service connection | `ManualValidation@0` |
| cli/cli | GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `production` environment approval |
| microsoft/mcp | AzDO job runs `gh release create` + upload | GitHub App token | Pipeline stage gate |

### dotnetup approach

dotnetup uses the `dotnet-monitor` pattern: an AzDO pipeline stage runs `gh release create --draft`
with a KeyVault-backed PAT, gated by `ManualValidation@1`.

- No GitHub App or cross-system dispatch to set up — a single pipeline stage on existing 1ES/dnceng
  infrastructure.
- `--draft` ensures a release is never published without a manual confirmation on GitHub.
- `ManualValidation@1` runs on a `pool: server` job with no agent cost.
- For `preview`, the manual gate may be dropped since the channel is internal, reducing release to a
  single pipeline run.
