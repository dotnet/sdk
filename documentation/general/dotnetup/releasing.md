# Publishing dotnetup Preview Builds

The `dotnetup` bootstrap scripts install from the `preview` quality by default. Publishing a
build to that quality updates links under:

```text
https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/preview/
```

Publishing an older build through the same process rolls those links back without rebuilding.

The [CI pipeline](../../../.vsts-dnup-ci.yml) prebuilds signed `daily` and `preview` candidates from the same commit and
registers them as separate BAR builds. Only the daily candidate is published automatically.
Promotion publishes the existing preview candidate; it does not rebuild, restamp, or sign it.

The pipeline requires an Arcade update with V4 `buildVariant` registration support,
including its shared templates, and matching variant discovery in Maestro Build Promotion.
Roll out the promotion support before enabling variant registration.

## Select a build

Use a successful
[`dotnet-dnup-official-ci`](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=1544)
run from the `release/dnup` branch. The build's tags include:

```text
BAR ID - <build-id>
```

There are two BAR IDs. Select the preview ID from the `Publish Build Assets` step in
`Asset_Registry_Publishpreview`, or from the first line of
`ReleaseConfigs_preview/ReleaseConfigs.txt`. Do not use the daily BAR ID for preview promotion.

Use that numeric Build Asset Registry (BAR) ID when promoting the build. Normal non-test runs
of the official pipeline are PME-signed and have a `PME Signed` tag. Use the tag to confirm
signing completed; do not promote a test build or a build without the tag.

## Promote the build

Run the
[`Maestro Build Promotion`](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=750)
pipeline with these parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `BARBuildId` | The preview BAR ID from the selected CI run |
| `PromoteToChannelIds` | `10506` (`dotnetup Daily`) |
| `ArtifactsPublishingAdditionalParameters` ( NOT `symbol` parameters ) | `/p:BuildQuality=preview` |

Leave the remaining parameters at their defaults. The Maestro channel retains its historical
`dotnetup Daily` name; `BuildQuality=preview` controls the quality segment in the generated
aka.ms links.

The promotion pipeline uses the selected BAR record to locate `AssetManifests_preview`.
No asset allowlist or `BlobBasePath` override is needed. Daily and preview have different
embedded version labels; the preview is the prebuilt counterpart of the dogfooded daily,
not byte-identical to it.

The overall pipeline can report `PartiallySucceeded` because optional artifacts are downloaded
with `continueOnError`. The `Publish packages, blobs and symbols` step must succeed.

## Verify the promotion

Check that the executable link resolves to the selected build's version:

```pwsh
curl.exe -sI https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/preview/dotnetup-win-x64.exe |
  Select-String Location
```

Then install into an isolated directory and check the running executable:

```pwsh
$script = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'get-dotnetup-preview.ps1'
$installDir = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'dotnetup-preview-test'

Invoke-WebRequest https://aka.ms/dotnet/dotnetup/preview/get-dotnetup.ps1 -OutFile $script
& $script -InstallDir $installDir
& (Join-Path $installDir 'dotnetup.exe') --info
```
