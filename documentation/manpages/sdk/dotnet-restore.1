.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] command uses NuGet to restore dependencies as well as project-specific tools that are specified in the project file.
In most cases, you don\[cq]t need to explicitly use the \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] command, since a NuGet restore is run implicitly if necessary when you run the following commands:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet new\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet build\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet build-server\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet run\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet test\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet publish\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]dotnet pack\f[R]
.PP
Sometimes, it might be inconvenient to run the implicit NuGet restore with these commands.
For example, some automated systems, such as build systems, need to call \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] explicitly to control when the restore occurs so that they can control network usage.
To prevent the implicit NuGet restore, you can use the \f[C]--no-restore\f[R] flag with any of these commands to disable implicit restore.
.SS Specify feeds
.PP
To restore the dependencies, NuGet needs the feeds where the packages are located.
Feeds are usually provided via the \f[I]nuget.config\f[R] configuration file.
A default configuration file is provided when the .NET SDK is installed.
To specify additional feeds, do one of the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
Create your own \f[I]nuget.config\f[R] file in the project directory.
For more information, see Common NuGet configurations and nuget.config differences later in this article.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[C]dotnet nuget\f[R] commands such as \f[C]dotnet nuget add source\f[R].
.PP
You can override the \f[I]nuget.config\f[R] feeds with the \f[C]-s\f[R] option.
.PP
For information about how to use authenticated feeds, see Consuming packages from authenticated feeds.
.SS Global packages folder
.PP
For dependencies, you can specify where the restored packages are placed during the restore operation using the \f[C]--packages\f[R] argument.
If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used, which is found in the \f[C].nuget/packages\f[R] directory in the user\[cq]s home directory on all operating systems.
For example, \f[I]/home/user1\f[R] on Linux or \f[I]C:\f[R] on Windows.
.SS Project-specific tooling
.PP
For project-specific tooling, \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] first restores the package in which the tool is packed, and then proceeds to restore the tool\[cq]s dependencies as specified in its project file.
.SS nuget.config differences
.PP
The behavior of the \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] command is affected by the settings in the \f[I]nuget.config\f[R] file, if present.
For example, setting the \f[C]globalPackagesFolder\f[R] in \f[I]nuget.config\f[R] places the restored NuGet packages in the specified folder.
This is an alternative to specifying the \f[C]--packages\f[R] option on the \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] command.
For more information, see the nuget.config reference.
.PP
There are three specific settings that \f[C]dotnet restore\f[R] ignores:
.IP \[bu] 2
bindingRedirects
.RS 2
.PP
Binding redirects don\[cq]t work with \f[C]<PackageReference>\f[R] elements and .NET only supports \f[C]<PackageReference>\f[R] elements for NuGet packages.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
solution
.RS 2
.PP
This setting is Visual Studio specific and doesn\[cq]t apply to .NET.
\&.NET doesn\[cq]t use a \f[C]packages.config\f[R] file and instead uses \f[C]<PackageReference>\f[R] elements for NuGet packages.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
trustedSigners
.RS 2
.PP
Support for cross-platform package signature verification was added in the .NET 5.0.100 SDK.
.RE
.SS Workload manifest downloads
.PP
When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.
If the download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.
For more information, see Advertising manifests.
.SS Arguments
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[CB]ROOT\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Optional path to the project file to restore.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[CB]--configfile <FILE>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
The NuGet configuration file (\f[I]nuget.config\f[R]) to use.
If specified, only the settings from this file will be used.
If not specified, the hierarchy of configuration files from the current directory will be used.
For more information, see Common NuGet Configurations.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[CB]--force\f[B]\f[R]

Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the \f[I]project.assets.json\f[R] file.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[CB]--force-evaluate\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
