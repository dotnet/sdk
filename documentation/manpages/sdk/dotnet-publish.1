.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]dotnet publish\f[R] compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes the resulting set of files to a directory.
The output includes the following assets:
.IP \[bu] 2
Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a \f[I]dll\f[R] extension.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I].deps.json\f[R] file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I].runtimeconfig.json\f[R] file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).
.IP \[bu] 2
The application\[cq]s dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet publish\f[R] command\[cq]s output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac, laptop) for execution.
It\[cq]s the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment.
Depending on the type of deployment that the project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET Core shared runtime installed on it.
For more information, see .NET Core Application Deployment.
For the directory structure of a published application, see Directory structure.
.PP
.SS Arguments
.PP
\f[C]PROJECT\f[R]
.PP
The project to publish.
It\[cq]s either the path and filename of a C#, F#, or Visual Basic project file, or the path to a directory that contains a C#, F#, or Visual Basic project file.
If not specified, it defaults to the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS .NET Core 2.1
.PP
\f[C]-c|--configuration {Debug|Release}\f[R]
.PP
Defines the build configuration.
The default value is \f[C]Debug\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>\f[R]
.PP
Publishes the application for the specified target framework.
You must specify the target framework in the project file.
.PP
\f[C]--force\f[R]
.PP
Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.
Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the \f[I]project.assets.json\f[R] file.
.PP
\f[C]-h|--help\f[R]
.PP
Prints out a short help for the command.
.PP
\f[C]--manifest <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Specifies one or several target manifests to use to trim the set of packages published with the app.
The manifest file is part of the output of the \f[C]dotnet store\f[R] command.
To specify multiple manifests, add a \f[C]--manifest\f[R] option for each manifest.
This option is available starting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK.
.PP
\f[C]--no-build\f[R]
.PP
Doesn\[cq]t build the project before publishing.
It also implicitly sets the \f[C]--no-restore\f[R] flag.
.PP
\f[C]--no-dependencies\f[R]
.PP
Ignores project-to-project references and only restores the root project.
.PP
\f[C]--no-restore\f[R]
.PP
Doesn\[cq]t execute an implicit restore when running the command.
.PP
\f[C]-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>\f[R]
.PP
Specifies the path for the output directory.
If not specified, it defaults to \f[I]./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/\f[R] for a framework-dependent deployment or \f[I]./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]/publish/\f[R] for a self-contained deployment.
If the path is relative, the output directory generated is relative to the project file location, not to the current working directory.
.PP
\f[C]--self-contained\f[R]
.PP
Publishes the .NET Core runtime with your application so the runtime doesn\[cq]t need to be installed on the target machine.
If a runtime identifier is specified, its default value is \f[C]true\f[R].
For more information about the different deployment types, see .NET Core application deployment.
.PP
\f[C]-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>\f[R]
.PP
Publishes the application for a given runtime.
This is used when creating a self-contained deployment (SCD).
For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.
Default is to publish a framework-dependent deployment (FDD).
.PP
\f[C]-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>\f[R]
.PP
Sets the verbosity level of the command.
Allowed values are \f[C]q[uiet]\f[R], \f[C]m[inimal]\f[R], \f[C]n[ormal]\f[R], \f[C]d[etailed]\f[R], and \f[C]diag[nostic]\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]--version-suffix <VERSION_SUFFIX>\f[R]
