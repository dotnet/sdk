.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes the resulting set of files to a directory.
The output includes the following assets:
.IP \[bu] 2
Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a \f[I]dll\f[R] extension.
.IP \[bu] 2
A \f[I].deps.json\f[R] file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.
.IP \[bu] 2
A \f[I].runtimeconfig.json\f[R] file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).
.IP \[bu] 2
The application\[cq]s dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] command\[cq]s output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac, laptop) for execution.
It\[cq]s the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment.
Depending on the type of deployment that the project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET shared runtime installed on it.
For more information, see Publish .NET apps with the .NET CLI.
.SS Implicit restore
.PP
You don\[cq]t have to run \f[V]dotnet restore\f[R] because it\[cq]s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as \f[V]dotnet new\f[R], \f[V]dotnet build\f[R], \f[V]dotnet run\f[R], \f[V]dotnet test\f[R], \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R], and \f[V]dotnet pack\f[R].
To disable implicit restore, use the \f[V]--no-restore\f[R] option.
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet restore\f[R] command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such as continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.
.PP
For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the \f[V]dotnet restore\f[R] documentation.
.SS MSBuild
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] command calls MSBuild, which invokes the \f[V]Publish\f[R] target.
If the \f[V]IsPublishable\f[R] property is set to \f[V]false\f[R] for a particular project, the \f[V]Publish\f[R] target can\[cq]t be invoked, and the \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] command only runs the implicit dotnet restore on the project.
.PP
Any parameters passed to \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] are passed to MSBuild.
The \f[V]-c\f[R] and \f[V]-o\f[R] parameters map to MSBuild\[cq]s \f[V]Configuration\f[R] and \f[V]PublishDir\f[R] properties, respectively.
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] command accepts MSBuild options, such as \f[V]-p\f[R] for setting properties and \f[V]-l\f[R] to define a logger.
For example, you can set an MSBuild property by using the format: \f[V]-p:<NAME>=<VALUE>\f[R].
.PP
You can also set publish-related properties by referring to a \f[I].pubxml\f[R] file.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dotnet publish -p:PublishProfile=FolderProfile
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The preceding example uses the \f[I]FolderProfile.pubxml\f[R] file that is found in the \f[I]<project_folder>/Properties/PublishProfiles\f[R] folder.
If you specify a path and file extension when setting the \f[V]PublishProfile\f[R] property, they are ignored.
MSBuild by default looks in the \f[I]Properties/PublishProfiles\f[R] folder and assumes the \f[I]pubxml\f[R] file extension.
To specify the path and filename including extension, set the \f[V]PublishProfileFullPath\f[R] property instead of the \f[V]PublishProfile\f[R] property.
.PP
The following MSBuild properties change the output of \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]PublishReadyToRun\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Compiles application assemblies as ReadyToRun (R2R) format.
R2R is a form of ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
For more information, see ReadyToRun images.
.PP
To see warnings about missing dependencies that could cause runtime failures, use \f[V]PublishReadyToRunShowWarnings=true\f[R].
.PP
We recommend that you specify \f[V]PublishReadyToRun\f[R] in a publish profile rather than on the command line.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]PublishSingleFile\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Packages the app into a platform-specific single-file executable.
For more information about single-file publishing, see the single-file bundler design document (https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/single-file/design.md).
.PP
We recommend that you specify this option in the project file rather than on the command line.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]PublishTrimmed\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Trims unused libraries to reduce the deployment size of an app when publishing a self-contained executable.
For more information, see Trim self-contained deployments and executables.
Available since .NET 6 SDK.
.PP
We recommend that you specify this option in the project file rather than on the command line.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]-a|--arch <ARCHITECTURE>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Specifies the target architecture.
This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provided value is combined with the default RID.
For example, on a \f[V]win-x64\f[R] machine, specifying \f[V]--arch x86\f[R] sets the RID to \f[V]win-x86\f[R].
If you use this option, don\[cq]t use the \f[V]-r|--runtime\f[R] option.
Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]-c|--configuration <CONFIGURATION>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Defines the build configuration.
The default for most projects is \f[V]Debug\f[R], but you can override the build configuration settings in your project.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Publishes the application for the specified target framework.
You must specify the target framework in the project file.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--force\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.
Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the \f[I]project.assets.json\f[R] file.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]-?|-h|--help\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Prints out a description of how to use the command.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--interactive\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.
For example, to complete authentication.
Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--manifest <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Specifies one or several target manifests to use to trim the set of packages published with the app.
The manifest file is part of the output of the \f[V]dotnet store\f[R] command.
To specify multiple manifests, add a \f[V]--manifest\f[R] option for each manifest.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--no-build\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Doesn\[cq]t build the project before publishing.
It also implicitly sets the \f[V]--no-restore\f[R] flag.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--no-dependencies\f[B]\f[R]

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Specifies the path for the output directory.
.PP
If not specified, it defaults to \f[I][project_file_folder]/bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/\f[R] for a framework-dependent executable and cross-platform binaries.
It defaults to \f[I][project_file_folder]/bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]/publish/\f[R] for a self-contained executable.
.PP
In a web project, if the output folder is in the project folder, successive \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] commands result in nested output folders.
For example, if the project folder is \f[I]myproject\f[R], and the publish output folder is \f[I]myproject/publish\f[R], and you run \f[V]dotnet publish\f[R] twice, the second run puts content files such as \f[I].config\f[R] and \f[I].json\f[R] files in \f[I]myproject/publish/publish\f[R].
To avoid nesting publish folders, specify a publish folder that is not \f[B]directly\f[R] under the project folder, or exclude the publish folder from the project.
To exclude a publish folder named \f[I]publishoutput\f[R], add the following element to a \f[V]PropertyGroup\f[R] element in the \f[I].csproj\f[R] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

If you specify a relative path when publishing a project, the generated output directory is relative to the current working directory, not to the project file location.
.PP
If you specify a relative path when publishing a solution, all output for all projects goes into the specified folder relative to the current working directory.
To make publish output go to separate folders for each project, specify a relative path by using the msbuild \f[V]PublishDir\f[R] property instead of the \f[V]--output\f[R] option.
For example, \f[V]dotnet publish -p:PublishDir=.\[rs]publish\f[R] sends publish output for each project to a \f[V]publish\f[R] folder under the folder that contains the project file.

\f[B]\f[VB]--os <OS>\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Specifies the target operating system (OS).
This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provided value is combined with the default RID.
For example, on a \f[V]win-x64\f[R] machine, specifying \f[V]--os linux\f[R] sets the RID to \f[V]linux-x64\f[R].
If you use this option, don\[cq]t use the \f[V]-r|--runtime\f[R] option.
Available since .NET 6.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\f[VB]--sc|--self-contained [true|false]\f[B]\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Publishes the .NET runtime with your application so the runtime doesn\[cq]t need to be installed on the target machine.
Default is \f[V]true\f[R] if a runtime identifier is specified and the project is an executable project (not a library project).
For more information, see .NET application publishing and Publish .NET apps with the .NET CLI.
.PP
If this option is used without specifying \f[V]true\f[R] or \f[V]false\f[R], the default is \f[V]true\f[R].
In that case, don\[cq]t put the solution or project argument immediately after \f[V]--self-contained\f[R], because \f[V]true\f[R] or \f[V]false\f[R] is expected in that position.

Sets the \f[V]RuntimeIdentifier\f[R] to a platform portable \f[V]RuntimeIdentifier\f[R] based on the one of your machine.
This happens implicitly with properties that require a \f[V]RuntimeIdentifier\f[R], such as \f[V]SelfContained\f[R], \f[V]PublishAot\f[R], \f[V]PublishSelfContained\f[R], \f[V]PublishSingleFile\f[R], and \f[V]PublishReadyToRun\f[R].
