.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command is deprecated.
The \f[V]dotnet migrate\f[R] command is no longer available starting with .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
It can only migrate a Preview 2 .NET Core project to a 1.x .NET Core project, which is out of support.
.PP
By default, the command migrates the root project and any project references that the root project contains.
This behavior is disabled using the \f[V]--skip-project-references\f[R] option at run time.
.PP
Migration can be performed on the following assets:
.IP \[bu] 2
A single project by specifying the \f[I]project.json\f[R] file to migrate.
.IP \[bu] 2
All of the directories specified in the \f[I]global.json\f[R] file by passing in a path to the \f[I]global.json\f[R] file.
.IP \[bu] 2
A \f[I]solution.sln\f[R] file, where it migrates the projects referenced in the solution.
.IP \[bu] 2
On all subdirectories of the given directory recursively.
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet migrate\f[R] command keeps the migrated \f[I]project.json\f[R] file inside a \f[V]backup\f[R] directory, which it creates if the directory doesn\[cq]t exist.
This behavior is overridden using the \f[V]--skip-backup\f[R] option.
.PP
By default, the migration operation outputs the state of the migration process to standard output (STDOUT).
If you use the \f[V]--report-file <REPORT_FILE>\f[R] option, the output is saved to the file specify.
.PP
The \f[V]dotnet migrate\f[R] command only supports valid Preview 2 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based projects.
This means that you cannot use it to migrate DNX or Preview 1 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based projects directly to MSBuild/csproj projects.
You first need to manually migrate the project to a Preview 2 \f[I]project.json\f[R]-based project and then use the \f[V]dotnet migrate\f[R] command to migrate the project.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
\f[V]PROJECT_JSON/GLOBAL_JSON/SOLUTION_FILE/PROJECT_DIR\f[R]
.PP
The path to one of the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]project.json\f[R] file to migrate.
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]global.json\f[R] file: the folders specified in \f[I]global.json\f[R] are migrated.
.IP \[bu] 2
a \f[I]solution.sln\f[R] file: the projects referenced in the solution are migrated.
.IP \[bu] 2
a directory to migrate: recursively searches for \f[I]project.json\f[R] files to migrate inside the specified directory.
.PP
Defaults to current directory if nothing is specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[V]--format-report-file-json <REPORT_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Output migration report file as JSON rather than user messages.
.PP
\f[V]-h|--help\f[R]
.PP
Prints out a short help for the command.
.PP
\f[V]-r|--report-file <REPORT_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Output migration report to a file in addition to the console.
.PP
\f[V]-s|--skip-project-references [Debug|Release]\f[R]
.PP
Skip migrating project references.
By default, project references are migrated recursively.
.PP
\f[V]--skip-backup\f[R]
.PP
Skip moving \f[I]project.json\f[R], \f[I]global.json\f[R], and \f[I]*.xproj\f[R] to a \f[V]backup\f[R] directory after successful migration.
.PP
\f[V]-t|--template-file <TEMPLATE_FILE>\f[R]
.PP
Template csproj file to use for migration.
By default, the same template as the one dropped by \f[V]dotnet new console\f[R] is used.
.PP
\f[V]-v|--sdk-package-version <VERSION>\f[R]
.PP
The version of the sdk package that\[cq]s referenced in the migrated app.
The default is the version of the SDK in \f[V]dotnet new\f[R].
.PP
\f[V]-x|--xproj-file <FILE>\f[R]
.PP
The path to the xproj file to use.
Required when there is more than one xproj in a project directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Migrate a project in the current directory and all of its project-to-project dependencies:
.PP
\f[V]dotnet migrate\f[R]
.PP
Migrate all projects that \f[I]global.json\f[R] file includes:
.PP
\f[V]dotnet migrate path/to/global.json\f[R]
.PP
Migrate only the current project and no project-to-project (P2P) dependencies.
Also, use a specific SDK version:
.PP
\f[V]dotnet migrate -s -v 1.0.0-preview4\f[R]
