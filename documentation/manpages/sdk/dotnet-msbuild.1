.SH NAME
.PP
\f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R] - Builds a project and all of its dependencies.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]dotnet msbuild <msbuild_arguments> [-h]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R] command allows access to a fully functional MSBuild.
.PP
The command has the exact same capabilities as the existing MSBuild command-line client for SDK-style project only.
The options are all the same.
For more information about the available options, see the MSBuild Command-Line Reference.
.PP
The dotnet build command is equivalent to \f[C]dotnet msbuild -restore -target:Build\f[R].
\f[C]dotnet build\f[R] is more commonly used for building projects, but \f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R] gives you more control.
For example, if you have a specific target you want to run (without running the build target), you probably want to use \f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R].
