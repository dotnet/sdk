.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R] command allows access to a fully functional MSBuild.
.PP
The command has the exact same capabilities as the existing MSBuild command-line client for SDK-style projects only.
The options are all the same.
For more information about the available options, see the MSBuild command-line reference.
.PP
The dotnet build command is equivalent to \f[C]dotnet msbuild -restore\f[R].
When you don\[cq]t want to build the project and you have a specific target you want to run, use \f[C]dotnet build\f[R] or \f[C]dotnet msbuild\f[R] and specify the target.
