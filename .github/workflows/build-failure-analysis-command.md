name: "Build Failure Analysis (command)"
description: >-
  Rerun the build-failure analysis on a pull request when a maintainer comments
  `/analyze-build-failure`. Same body as `build-failure-analysis.md` — it does
  NOT rebuild: it inspects the PR's **latest** Azure Pipelines `dotnet-sdk-public-ci`
  build and, **only when that latest build has failed** (it stops if the
  newest build is still running or has succeeded), downloads the binary logs
  that build already produced (all build legs) and delegates to the
  `build-failure-analyst` agent (which queries the binlogs live via the
  containerized `binlog-mcp` MCP server). Useful when a previous run was
  cancelled, the analysis comment was dismissed, or the agent needs another
  pass. Like the auto workflow it performs **no build**; the generated jobs do
  check out the repository (and, for the slash-command event, the PR branch)
  for agent tooling only — the PR's code is never built or executed.

  slash_command:
    name: analyze-build-failure

  # Gate the AI pipeline on the fetch job so the agent only runs when a binlog
  # was actually retrieved from a failed Azure DevOps build.
  needs: [fetch-binlog]

# Skip activation (and the agent) unless a binlog was retrieved — e.g. if the
# PR's latest Azure DevOps build did not fail, or the PR is out of scope.
if: needs.fetch-binlog.outputs.binlog-found == 'true'

# Least-privilege for the workflow/agent jobs. The agent runs read-only; it
# does NOT post directly. All PR writes it produces (summary comment + inline
# review suggestions) go through gh-aw **safe-outputs**, which the compiler
# emits as a separate `safe_outputs` job granted `pull-requests: write` +
# `issues: write` in the generated lock. (The slash-command trigger also adds
# an acknowledgement reaction to the command comment; gh-aw emits that in its
# own generated job with the scope it needs — it is not driven by this agent
# job.) Keep `pull-requests: read` here so the AI agent job stays
# least-privilege — do NOT raise it to `write`, that would hand PR-write scope
# to the agent job unnecessarily.

  # Distinct from the automatic workflow's group (`build-failure-analysis-<pr>`).
  # Concurrency groups are repository-global, so sharing the name made the two
  # workflows cancel each other for the same PR: a newly failing build would
  # kill an on-demand analysis a maintainer had just asked for. Each still
  # collapses its own repeat invocations for a PR.

# Narrow the safe-output target for the on-demand path.
#
# The rest of `safe-outputs` comes from shared/build-failure-analysis-shared.md;
# gh-aw lets the main workflow override an individual safe-output type, and only
# `target` is intended to differ here. Unlike the automatic (check_run/dispatch)
# workflow, this one HAS a triggering item — the PR the command was typed on —
# and `fetch-binlog` resolves that very same PR from `github.event.issue.number`,
# so `triggering` is equivalent by construction while removing the agent's
# ability to name a different issue/PR. `"*"` stays unavoidable on the automatic
# path, which has no triggering item; see the note in the shared file.
#
# KEEP IN SYNC with `safe-outputs` in shared/build-failure-analysis-shared.md:
# overriding a type replaces it wholesale, so `max` and `hide-older-comments`
# are restated verbatim and must not be allowed to drift.

# Custom job that reuses the binlogs from the PR's most recent failed Azure
# DevOps `dotnet-sdk-public-ci` build instead of rebuilding. Mirrors the fetch-binlog job
# in build-failure-analysis.md; it locates the build by the PR's merge branch
# (no `check_run` payload is available on a slash command).
# Steps that run in the agent job. The top-level `if:` gates these on binlogs
# having been retrieved, so the agent never runs without something to analyse.
