  Shared `fetch-binlog` job for the Build Failure Analysis workflows. Resolves
  the PR's failed `dotnet-sdk-public-ci` Azure DevOps build, downloads the
  binary logs that build already produced and stages them for the analysis
  agent. It performs **no build**: it only reads published build artifacts.

# Both Build Failure Analysis workflows — the automatic one (`check_run`) and
# the `/analyze-build-failure` slash command (`issue_comment`) — need exactly
# the same download engine, but they cannot be a single workflow: gh-aw's
# `roles:` is one workflow-scoped gate, and the two need different ones. The
# automatic analysis is advisory and must run on **every** failing PR including
# external contributors' (`roles: all`), while the slash command spends the
# download on demand and is restricted to `[admin, maintainer, write]`.
#
# So the job lives here instead and both workflows import it. Only the build/PR
# resolution differs by trigger, and that is a single `if` at the top of the
# script; everything after it — artifact enumeration, missing-leg detection,
# the download/extraction budgets and the fail-closed completeness checks — is
# shared, so a fix lands in both workflows at once.
jobs:
  fetch-binlog:
    name: Fetch binlogs (Azure Pipelines)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    # Cheap pre-gate covering every trigger this job is imported under. Each
    # importing workflow only ever fires one of these branches; the others are
    # simply never true.
    #
    # `check_run` fires for every check on a commit, so only the rollup
    # `dotnet-sdk-public-ci` check reporting failure is acted on.
    #
    # The `issue_comment` branch matters most: this job is a dependency of
    # gh-aw's `pre_activation`, so it runs BEFORE the role / command-position
    # check. Without a guard it would download hundreds of MB of binlogs on
    # *every* comment in the repository, which any public commenter could
    # trigger repeatedly. This expression is only the free first filter —
    # `author_association` is coarse (in an org-owned repo every org member
    # reports MEMBER regardless of the permission they actually hold here), so
    # the step below resolves the commenter's real repository permission before
    # anything is downloaded. `pre_activation` remains the authoritative role +
    # command-position check, and `activation` additionally requires
    # `binlog-found == 'true'`.

      # job-level `if:`: the comment must actually INVOKE the command (not just
      # mention it — `contains()` is a substring test), and the commenter must
      # really have write access (`author_association` cannot tell an org member
      # with read-only access apart from a maintainer). Both are checked here,
      # before any download. `pre_activation` remains the authoritative role +
      # command-position check, and `activation` additionally requires
      # `binlog-found == 'true'`; this step exists because gh-aw schedules
      # `pre_activation` AFTER this job, so its checks come too late to prevent
      # the cost. KEEP IN SYNC with `roles:` in build-failure-analysis-command.md.
      #
      # `.permission` is the field to test. The REST docs for this endpoint say
      # it returns the legacy base roles admin|write|read|none, "where the
      # maintain role is mapped to write and the triage role is mapped to read",
      # so `admin|write` is exactly "has push access or better" — precisely the
      # set `roles: [admin, maintainer, write]` describes, maintainers included.
      #
      # `.role_name` is deliberately NOT consulted. It reports "the name of the
      # assigned role, including custom roles", and a custom organization role
      # only has to avoid the base names read/triage/write/maintain/admin — so
      # matching on it would let a role merely *named* like a privileged one
      # (say a custom `maintainer` inheriting read) clear this gate with no push
      # access at all.
      #
      # On any API failure the response carries no `.permission`, so the check
      # falls into the deny branch; failing closed is the safe direction here.
