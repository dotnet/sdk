# List of components

To enable full offline source-building of the VMR, we have no other choice than to synchronize all the necessary code into the VMR. This also includes any code referenced via git submodules. More details on why and how this is done can be found here:
- [Strategy for managing external source dependencies](src/arcade/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)
- [Source Synchronization Process](src/arcade/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md#source-synchronization-process)

The repository also contains a [JSON manifest](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/src/source-manifest.json) listing all components in a machine-readable format.
