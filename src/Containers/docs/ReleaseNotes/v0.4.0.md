### Special thanks

A big shout-out to [Daniel Kuschny](@danielku15) for his contributions to this release! Daniel investigated and solved some fundamental issues around to how we create archives to send to a local container daemon. He also diagnosed and added support for Artifactory JFrog container registries, as well as implemented support for Windows Containers.
