# Tasks Agent Instructions

Guidance for changes under `src/Tasks` (MSBuild tasks, targets, and SDK build messages).

## Where things live

Four projects, all multi-targeted (`net472` + current .NET) so tasks load in both
full-framework and .NET Core MSBuild:

| Project | Role |
|---------|------|
| `Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks` | The core `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` task assembly **and** the targets that compose `dotnet build`. Ships in the SDK. |
| `Common` | Common shared source **linked into** both task assemblies — not its own package. |
| `Microsoft.NET.Build.Extensions.Tasks` | Tasks/targets for desktop/.NET Framework projects built **outside** the SDK. |
| `sdk-tasks` | Build-time-only tasks for **this repo's own** build/packaging — never shipped to users. |

### Inside `Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks`

- Root `*.cs` — the MSBuild `Task` classes.
- `targets/` — the shipping `.targets`/`.props` that drive a build;
  `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.props` / `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets` are the top-level entry
  points, and `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Common.targets` registers the diagnostic tasks.
- `sdk/` — `Sdk.props` / `Sdk.targets`, the entry points when the SDK is referenced
  via the `<Sdk>` attribute.
- `FrameworkPackages/` — per-TFM runtime framework version data.

## Build diagnostics (NETSDK errors / warnings / info)

These are conventions that aren't visible from the code alone — getting them wrong
breaks localization or silently collides with another PR.

- **Diagnostics are raised from targets, never as literal text.** Use
  `<NETSdkError/>`, `<NETSdkWarning/>`, or `<NETSdkInformation/>` (registered in
  `Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Common.targets`) and reference
  the message **by `ResourceName`** from the shared `Common/Resources/Strings.resx`:

  ```xml
  <NETSdkError Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == ''"
               ResourceName="TargetFrameworkEmpty"
               FormatArguments="$([MSBuild]::Escape('$(SomeValue)'))" />
  ```

- **The NETSDK code lives in the value, not in metadata.** In `Strings.resx` the
  `<value>` begins with the code (`NETSDK1238: The property '{0}' ...`), and the
  `<comment>` carries the localization directives — `{StrBegins="NETSDK1238: "}` plus
  `{Locked="{0}"}` per placeholder (or `{Locked="--option"}` for literal flags).
- **Message entries are append-only.** Add new strings at the **end** of the resx with
  the **next available** NETSDK number, and update the trailing
  `<!-- The latest message added is <Name>. -->` guard comment — it exists so two PRs
  adding a message conflict in git instead of silently reusing a code. (The root
  instructions carry the one-line version of this rule.)
- **`.xlf` files are generated**, never hand-edited — regenerate via `/t:UpdateXlf`.

Diagnostics are covered by tests under `test/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tests/`.
