    This target detects old Aspire applications that still depend on the deprecated Aspire workload.

    Starting with Aspire 9.0.0, Aspire moved from a workload-based distribution model to NuGet packages
    with the Aspire.AppHost.Sdk. Projects using the old workload-based approach need to be upgraded.

    Detection logic:
    - IsAspireHost='true' indicates this is an Aspire host project
    - AspireHostingSDKVersion is set by Aspire.AppHost.Sdk in new projects (9.0.0+)
    - If AspireHostingSDKVersion is missing or < 9.0.0, this is likely an old workload-based project

    This check runs before PrepareForBuild to catch the issue early in the build process.

    Note: This error provides a clear upgrade message for customers. Without it, users would get
    confusing errors about missing workloads that no longer exist, since the Aspire workload has
    been removed from the SDK.
