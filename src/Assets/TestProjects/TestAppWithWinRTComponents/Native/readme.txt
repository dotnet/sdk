    C++/WinRT Native Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates how to get started consuming Windows Runtime 
classes directly from standard C++, using platform projection headers
generated from Windows SDK metadata files.

Steps to generate and consume SDK platform projection:
1. Build project initially to generate platform projection headers into
    your Generated Files folder.
2. Include a projection namespace header in your pch.h, such as 
    <winrt/Windows.Foundation.h>.
3. Consume winrt namespace and any Windows Runtime namespaces, such as 
    winrt::Windows::Foundation, from source code.
4. Initialize apartment via init_apartment() and consume winrt classes.

Steps to generate and consume a projection from third party metadata:
1. Add a WinMD reference by right-clicking the References project node
    and selecting "Add Reference...".  In the Add References dialog, 
    browse to the component WinMD you want to consume and add it.
2. Build the project once to generate projection headers for the 
    referenced WinMD file under the "Generated Files" subfolder.
3. As above, include projection headers in pch or source code 
    to consume projected Windows Runtime classes.
