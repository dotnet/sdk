# dotnetup Telemetry

dotnetup includes a telemetry feature that collects usage data and sends it to
Microsoft when you use dotnetup commands. The usage data includes exception
information when dotnetup crashes. Telemetry data helps the .NET team understand
how the tools are used so they can be improved. Information on failures helps
the team resolve problems and fix bugs.

## How to Opt Out

The dotnetup telemetry feature is enabled by default. To opt out of the telemetry
feature, set the `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

To suppress the first-run telemetry notice without disabling telemetry, set the
`DOTNET_NOLOGO` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

## First-Run Notice

dotnetup displays the following message on first run:

    dotnetup collects usage data to help improve your experience. You can opt out
    by setting the DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to '1'.

## Data Points

The telemetry feature doesn't collect personal data, such as usernames or email
addresses. It does not scan your code and does not extract project-level data.
The data is sent securely to Microsoft servers using Azure Monitor
(https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) technology.

Data collected includes:

- Timestamp of invocation
- Command invoked (e.g., "install", "update", "list")
- dotnetup version and commit SHA
- Operating system and architecture
- Whether running in a CI environment
- Whether running from an LLM agent (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude)
- Exit code / success or failure status
- For failures: error type, error category, and sanitized error details
  (no file paths)

## Crash Exception Telemetry

If dotnetup crashes, it collects the name of the exception and stack trace of
the dotnetup code and dotnetup invoked code only. The collected data contains the exception type and a
sanitized stack trace that includes method names and line numbers from dotnetup
source code, but NOT file paths.

Example of collected crash data:

    ErrorType: IOException
    Category: Product
    SourceLocation: Downloader.DownloadAsync:145@abc123d
    ExceptionChain: IOException->SocketException

## CI and LLM Agent Detection

dotnetup uses the same CI environment detection and LLM agent detection as the
.NET SDK. For details on which environment variables are checked, see the
.NET CLI telemetry documentation:
https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry

## Privacy

Protecting your privacy is important to Microsoft. If you suspect the telemetry
is collecting sensitive data or the data is being insecurely or inappropriately
handled, file an issue in the dotnet/sdk repository:
https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues
