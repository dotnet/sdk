      Building .NET from source depends on several archives, depending on the branch's current
      source-buildability status.

      PrivateSourceBuiltArtifactsUrl is a tar.gz of .NET build outputs from a previous
      build needed to build the current version of .NET. This is always defined, because .NET needs
      to be bootstrappable at any point in time.

      PrivateSourceBuiltPrebuiltsUrl is a tar.gz of assets downloaded from the internet
      that are needed to build the current version of .NET. Early in the lifecycle of a .NET major
      or minor release, prebuilts may be needed. When the release is mature, prebuilts are not
      necessary, and this property is removed from the file.

      PrivateSourceBuiltSdkUrl_<abc> is a tar.gz of the source build .NET SDK from the previous release
      for a particular OS. It is used by CI to validate that the current release can be built with it.

      These URLs can't be composed from their base URL and version as we read them from the
      prep.sh and pipeline scripts, outside of MSBuild.
