This Codespace can help you debug the source build of .NET. This build takes about
45 minutes and, after completion, produces an archived .NET SDK located in
`/workspaces/dotnet/artifacts/assets/Release`. In case you selected the `prebuilt-sdk`
Codespace, the built-from-source SDK will already be there.

## Build the SDK

To build the repository, run one of the following:
```bash
# Microsoft based build
./build.sh
```
or

```bash
# Building from source only
./prep-source-build.sh && ./build.sh -sb
```

> Please note that, at this time, the build modifies some of the checked-in sources so it might
be preferential to rebuild the Codespace between attempts (or reset the working tree changes).

For more details, see the instructions at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet.

## Synchronize your changes in locally

When debugging the build, you have two options how to test your changes in this environment.

### Making changes to the VMR directly

You can make the changes directly to the local checkout of the VMR at `/workspaces/dotnet`. You
can then try to build the VMR and see if the change works for you.

### Pull changes into the Codespace from your fork

You can also make a fix in the individual source repository (e.g. `dotnet/runtime`) and push the
fix into a branch; can be in your fork too. Once you have the commit pushed, you can pull this
version of the repository into the Codespace by running:

```
/workspaces/synchronize-vmr.sh                \
  --repository <repo>:<commit, tag or branch> \
  --remote <repo>:<fork URI>
```

You can now proceed building the VMR in the Codespace using instructions above. You can repeat
this process and sync a new commit from your fork. Only note that, at this time, Source-Build
modifies some of the checked-in sources so you'll need to revert the working tree changes
between attempts.
