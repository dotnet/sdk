# Contains the list of files whose assembly versions are to be excluded from comparison between the MSFT & SB SDK.
# These exclusions only take effect if the assembly version of the file in the SB SDK is equal to or greater than
# the version in the MSFT SDK. If the version is less, the file will show up in the results as this is not a scenario
# that is valid for shipping.
#
# This list is processed using FileSystemName.MatchesSimpleExpression
#
# '*' in exclusions match zero or more characters.
# '*' will match files and directory names but it will not match separator characters.
# '/' will be evaluated as '/**' if it is the last character.
#
# Examples
# 'folder/*' matches all files and directories in 'folder/'. It will not match 'folder/abc/def'
# 'folder/' is equivalent to 'folder/**. It matches 'folder/', 'folder/abc', and 'folder/abc/def/'
