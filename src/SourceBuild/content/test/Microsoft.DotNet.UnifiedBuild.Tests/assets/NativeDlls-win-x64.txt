# Contains the list of native .dll and .exe files that shouldn't have their assembly version checked.
#
# This list is processed using FileSystemName.MatchesSimpleExpression
#
# Examples
# 'folder/*' matches 'folder/' and 'folder/abc'
# 'folder/?*' matches 'folder/abc' but not 'folder/'
#
# We do not want to filter-out folder entries, therefore, we should use: '?*' and not just '*'
