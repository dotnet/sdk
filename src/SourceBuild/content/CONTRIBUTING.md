Contributing
============

See [dotnet/runtime](./src/runtime/CONTRIBUTING.md) for general contribution guidelines such as allowed licenses.

At this time, the VMR will not accept any changes and is a read-only mirror of the development repositories only.
Please, make the changes in the respective development repositories (e.g., [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) or [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)) and they will get synchronized into the VMR automatically.
