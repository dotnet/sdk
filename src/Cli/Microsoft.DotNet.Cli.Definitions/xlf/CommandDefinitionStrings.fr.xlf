        <source>Runs the tests in blame mode and collects a crash dump when the test host exits unexpectedly. This option depends on the version of .NET used, the type of error, and the operating system.

For exceptions in managed code, a dump will be automatically collected on .NET 5.0 and later versions. It will generate a dump for testhost or any child process that also ran on .NET 5.0 and crashed. Crashes in native code will not generate a dump. This option works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Crash dumps in native code, or when targetting .NET Framework, or .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions, can only be collected on Windows, by using Procdump. A directory that contains procdump.exe and procdump64.exe must be in the PATH or PROCDUMP_PATH environment variable.

The tools can be downloaded here: https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/procdump

To collect a crash dump from a native application running on .NET 5.0 or later, the usage of Procdump can be forced by setting the VSTEST_DUMP_FORCEPROCDUMP environment variable to 1.

        <source>'dotnet workload search version' has three functions depending on its argument:
      1. If no argument is specified, it outputs a list of the latest released workload versions from this feature band. Takes the --take option to specify how many to provide and --format to alter the format.
         Example:
           dotnet workload search version --take 2 --format json
           [{"workloadVersion":"9.0.201"},{"workloadVersion":"9.0.200.1"}]
      2. If a workload version is provided as an argument, it outputs a table of various workloads and their versions for the specified workload version. Takes the --format option to alter the output format.
         Example:
